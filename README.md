Mini react project showcasing form validation using Hooks.

There are two main data chunks: formMetaData where we store information about all of the fields that are supposed to be rendered, including which validation rules will apply to them and State where we store form inputs. Validation methods are stored inside it's own module called formValidators.js. Input validation happens on form submit and on input(only after touched).

DEMO is hosted on Github pages: https://mishabatsiashvili.github.io/CustomFormValidationReactHooks/
